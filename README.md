# Chalchitra

A small Python module to help creating GUI based tests, using mouse clicks and
keyboard typing. This is built on top of the excellent
[PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest) module.


## Dependency

On Debian

```
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
```

On Fedora

```
sudo dnf install opencv -y
```

For now you will have to install from source as this is in development.

## Usage guide

Please have a look at the [documentation](https://chalchitra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).
